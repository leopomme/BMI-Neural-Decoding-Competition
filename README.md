Neural Decoding Competition.
Provided with spike trains recorded from a monkey's brain, as it repeatedly performs an
arm movement task. This algorithm will estimate, from these data, the precise trajectory of the
monkey's hand as it reaches for the target.  
Estimate the X & Y position of the monkey's hand at each moment in time.
